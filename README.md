This is a project as an idea for a GUI for the Pokemon Go PokeMobBot. It is purely the GUI look/feel. It isn't integrated in any way with the other projects. I am offering this up as an prototype idea.  The project can be compiled or run to show the GUI and how it would be intended to function.

The intention is that when compiling the project, the gui would compile just like the CLI and the GUI use the main classes to access the settings and listen to events.
